  title: Mission Statement
  summary: |
    I am focusing on bridging the gap between state-of-the-art AI models, 
    such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, 
    and the real needs within healthcare. My main research focus is in the automated 
    diagnosis of chronic, non-transmissible conditions for prevention and early intervention. 
    To achieve this, I’m building an intersectional profile of three equal parts: 
    clinician, machine learning engineer and entrepreneurship
