career-profile:
  title: A bit about me
  summary: |
    Hello! Thank you for stopping by! My name is Diego and I'm a dentist from Chile, who then turned ML researcher for healthcare!
    I focus on bridging the gap between state-of-the-art AI models, such as Computer Vision and NLP, and the real needs within healthcare. 
    My main research interest is automating the diagnosis of chronic, non-transmissible diseases for better prevention. I'm building an 
    intersectional profile of three equal parts: clinician, machine learning engineer and entrepreneurship.
